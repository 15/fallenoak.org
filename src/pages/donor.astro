          When one thinks of manâ€™s best friend, they may think of many different
          animals, but none compare to the horse. Whether serving by our side in
          combat, enabling transport across vast landscapes to further human
          expansion, assisting in the application of science, or even just
          providing comfort and care to those in need, these beautiful and
          majestic creatures are deserving of only the best for helping to
          uplift us into the society we have today! However, they often find
          their kindness and servitude not going unpunished in life: abuse,
          neglect, illness, and other woes often befall these gentle giants.
          Very few people consider the plight of these exquisite equines - even
          fewer do anything to help alleviate their suffering - though there is
          one person who has risen to the occasion and crafted her life around
          supporting and caring for horses: Kim Sweeney, owner and president of
          Fallen Oak Equine Rescue.

          While Mrs. Sweeney has what it takes to care for these horses and prolong/rehabilitate them in a comfortable and healthy environment, she needs all the help she can get! If you are concerned for the care of at-risk horses and want to directly contribute to an organization with a proven commitment and track record of supporting and rehabilitating these animals - and get some nice rewards in the process - a monthly donation as low as $1 would be helping to ensure these and other horses get all the help they need.
