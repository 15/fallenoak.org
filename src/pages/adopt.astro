          Adopting is not only a chance to give a horse a new lease on life, but
          also a chance to befriend someone with a rich history and deep
          personality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of our horses come from rough backgrounds, so we look to ensure
          that the next chapter that they begin is a happy and
          comfortable one. To uphold that promise, we require that
          potential adoptees have no barbed wire fencing, have appropriate shelter and housing for
          the horse, and have owned a horse in the past. We also require that
          potential adoptees provide the adopted
          horse with a companion horse, and that they be free of any past
          conviction of animal cruelty or neglect.
        </p>
        <p>
          To submit an application to adopt a horse, download and fill out the
          form below, and then email the completed form to <a
          href="mailto:kim@fallenoak.org"
          class="hover:underline text-blue-500 font-medium underline-offset-4 duration-300"
          >kim@fallenoak.org</a
        >. Once the application
          has been reviewed, you'll be notified via email of your
          preliminary approval status. Next, you will need to meet and
          potentially ride the horse, ensuring that they're a good fit for you. And
          if you and the horse feel good about each other, then you'll have a
          new friend to bring home.
