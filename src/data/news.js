    title: "Semi's Adoption",
    content: `Semi has been adopted!

    Semi came to us last summer and was first adopted out in September but, sadly, he was having some riding issues and didn't work out with his adopter. At some point in Semi's life he had some trauma that causes him to become terrified and shake while being ridden in certain situations. As a result, he came back to the rescue on March 7th.
    Despite his issues with riding, he is a lovely horse with excellent ground manners. So we decided that it was time for Semi to just be a horse and hang out with friends as a companion horse. Months later, the wonderful people at Rainbows Edge Equine Transition Center reached out to us about a lady who was looking for a companion horse.
    Kim swiftly reached out and invited her and her husband to come visit the rescue and as soon as the couple met Semi they were enthralled with him! Semi now lives in Gainesville Florida on a beautiful farm with his new best friend, Phoenix.
    
    We are so thankful for Gloria and her husband for providing Semi with a loving home!`,

    title: "Three New Rescue Horses in Need of Help!",
    content: `Three new horses have recently arrived at the rescue: Honey, Major and Dusty!

    Honey had first been rescued three and a half years ago, but through a series of unfortunate events, kept bouncing around between owners that were neglecting to take proper care of her. Eventually, she wound up back in our care. Despite bounding from home to home, she’s kept her sweet, lovely demeanor. Honey will be able to be sponsored in the future, once we know the extent of her medical needs.
    
    Major and Dusty both come from the same place, ex-reining horses that also took part in horse shows and worked with cattle, whose owners tragically passed away. The people that inherited them sadly could not provide proper care, and asked for us to take them in. Major is a very kind horse that greatly enjoys the company of people. He’s not as energetic as he used to be, but he’s also a little thin. With some tender love and care, he may gain some of his energy back! Dusty is also very kind, a laid back and relaxed horse. Both of them are up for sponsorship at $440 a month, per horse, to make sure their medical costs are covered.
    
    Due to the severity of their condition, it will take considerable amounts of time, love, and care to nurse them back to health. Any donations that you can spare will be a huge aid towards their recovery so these horses in need can get the life they deserve with us at the sanctuary, where they will live out their days.

  //   content: `
  //   To show love for our supporters, we’re excited to present monthly donor and sponsor rewards!

  //   Perks will be available to all those who are sponsoring a horse or making a regular contribution to the rescue, with different tiers for all monthly donors ranging from $1 all the way up to $1000 per month. Included in these perks are things like a subscription to the monthly Fallen Oak newsletter, having your name and a bio about you or your business on the site, signed photos of the horses and a whole host of other perks!

  //   By sponsoring a horse, they effectively become yours but stay at the rescue to be fed, looked after and cared for. It’s a way to have your very own horse, without having to own the land needed to keep them or being burdened with the responsibility of feeding them and cleaning out the stalls (unless you’d like to come and help with that).

  //   Your sponsorship money will be used to cover the horse’s monthly financial needs including food, medication and hoof trims, and you’ll be able to have an input on any of the major decisions regarding your horse’s care. Sponsors also receive regular updates on their special steed, with photos, a small lock of the mane or tail and the option to have a description & photo of you and your horse featured on the website. You can also come out to the rescue and spend some time with the horse and brush them, and for some horses you’ll even have the option to change their name.

  //   If you’re interested in sponsoring a horse or making a monthly contribution to the rescue, be sure to check out the sponsor and donor sections of the site!
